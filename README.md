# Problem

Volatile generation capacities such as PV and wind pose major challenges for electricity grids. Batteries can contribute both from a grid-supporting perspective and to improving the market situation (negative electricity prices). 

A TechLabs project addressing challenges in electricity grids caused by volatile generation capacities like PV and wind. Using market, weather, and demand data, we aim to build a predictive model for optimizing battery dispatch strategies to stabilize grids and improve market outcomes.

# Solution

The aim is to use market data as well as weather and demand data to build a predictive model that contains a dispatch strategy for storing and withdrawing electricity.

# Method/How?

- Get Data from EPEX and other market sources as well as weather data and demand curves from Energycharts
- Clean and filter data to remove outliers, inconsistencies, and noise that may affect analysis.
- Machine Learning regressions to build an predictive model
- Model the dispatch with financial data
- Real time implementation
